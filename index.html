								Hi! I'm Jordan, a second year biology PhD student at the University of Oregon.
								I am an avid gardener, runner, and friend, and I enjoy spending most of my time either hanging out with my cat or doing anything outdoors. Born & raised in south Texas,
								I love breakfast tacos and the sun!

								<b>Education:</b><br><strong>In progress</strong>- PhD in Biology - University of Oregon<br><strong>2021</strong>- B.S. in Environmental Science - Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>I'm a member of the (really cool) <a href="https://kr-colab.github.io/">Kern Ralph co-lab</a>, where much of our research involves machine learning applications 
								to population genetics. My current research questions are: <i>What is the connection between environmental variation and genetic variation?</i>, and <i>How can machine learning algorithms inform us of this connection?</i> More broadly, I am 
								interested in bioinformatic methods and tools development, and I hope to be an educator in this area someday.
